# Sorting Visualizer - Java-based GUI Application

## Project Overview
The **Sorting Visualizer** is a Java-based GUI application that demonstrates and visualizes the step-by-step execution of popular sorting algorithms. It allows users to see the sorting process in action, using a bar chart representation. The application supports **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Merge Sort**, providing a dynamic and interactive way to explore sorting algorithms.

Built using **Java Swing** and following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the application provides a clear visual and performance breakdown of the sorting process, including the number of swaps, comparisons, and iterations performed by each algorithm.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Visualizes the sorting process step by step using bar charts.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Supports Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Performance Metrics:** Displays key metrics such as the number of swaps, iterations, and comparisons.
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly interface with controls to select algorithms and start sorting.
- **Customizable Sorting Speed:** Adjust the speed of the sorting process for better visualization.

## Features:
- **Visual Sorting Representation:** The sorting steps are shown in real-time, where each bar represents an element in the array. As the algorithm progresses, the heights of the bars change to show the sorting operation.
- **Metrics Display:** The application tracks and displays the number of swaps, iterations, and comparisons performed by each sorting algorithm, helping users understand the algorithmâ€™s efficiency.
- **User Selection:** Users can select from a range of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort) using a dropdown menu.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** The sorting process occurs in steps, with each step clearly visible to the user.
- **Swing-based GUI:** Built using Java Swing, providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Class Diagram
The **Class Diagram** for this project is available in the repository. It illustrates the structure of the application, including the main classes like `SortingVisualizer`, `BubbleSort`, `InsertionSort`, `SelectionSort`, `QuickSort`, and `MergeSort`, as well as their relationships.

## Scenario Diagram
The **Scenario Diagram** can also be found in the repository. It explains the flow of actions within the application, from selecting an algorithm to visualizing the sorting process and displaying the corresponding metrics.

## Prerequisites
- **Java 8+** or later
- **Swing** library for GUI
- **JDK** for compiling and running the application
